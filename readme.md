  <p style="color: green">MOBILE RESPONSIVE</p>

- This assignment was not quite difficut but the `background-image` part was a bit tricky as it used a `conic-gradient` from left to right. Also to make this assignment Mobile Responsive I have used `flex-direction` and set it to `column-reverse`

## Learnings

- I used the `background-image` property and styled it with `conic-gradient`
- I used `flex-direction` property and set it to `column-reverse` to achieve Mobile Responsiveness in `@media-queries`
